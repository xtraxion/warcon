# Warcon

A self-hostable, multi-server RCON panel for **WARDOGS** dedicated servers. Bun, SvelteKit and
Postgres/TimescaleDB, deployed with Docker Compose. Run it beside your game server, on any VPS, or
on a container host, with the database wherever you like.

It is for anyone who runs a WARDOGS server: a clan with one box, a community with a dozen, or a
host with hundreds. Everybody on the team gets their own login instead of the RCON password, the
panel keeps the history the game throws away, and the worker can act on what it sees. Pick your
way in:

- **Just want to run it?** [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) is the plain-language
  walkthrough: Docker, one `.env` file, done. [Deploy with Docker](#deploy-with-docker) below has
  the detail.
- **Want a look first?** Every install comes with a built-in demo server, so you can click around
  the whole panel before pointing it at a real one.
- **Want to hack on it?** [Local development](#local-development) gets you running in a few
  minutes and [Contributing](#contributing) says what a change needs. Questions and half-formed
  ideas are welcome in the issues.

What is in the box:

- **Multiple servers** in one panel, each with its own encrypted RCON password.
- **Organisations and invite links**: each clan or community is an organisation with its own
  servers, owners and members. An owner pastes an invite link into their Discord; whoever opens it
  signs in with Discord (creating their account on the spot) and joins with the roles the link
  carries. Per-server roles on top: every org starts with `viewer` / `operator` / `admin`, and its
  owners can change what those may do or add roles of their own.
- **Account management**: Better Auth accounts; password resets, forced password change, disable,
  session revocation, login throttling.
- **Full audit trail**: every login, user or server change, and every game-server command, with
  actor, server, target, outcome, upstream status and duration. Filterable and exportable
  (CSV/JSON). The game server's own listener log is shown alongside it; the addresses of its peers
  are shown to the site owner only.
- **Live view**: a worker process watches every server on a cadence that follows what is
  happening: every second or two while someone has it open or people are on it, every half
  minute when it is empty. Pages get each observation as it happens over an event stream, and a
  command you send shows its effect on the next look. Browsers never talk to a game server.
- **Past players**: the Players tab switches between who is on now and everyone who has played on
  that server, searched by name, alias, a name the kill feed showed for them or SteamID64, with
  when they were last on, their sessions and playtime. Anyone who can open the server can look; a
  row's Ban (for people who hold _Bans_) lands the moment the player next joins, and Watch needs
  _Notes_.
- **Arrange the teams**: the Players tab's Teams view shows who is on each side, one column per
  faction. With _Move_, drag players between the columns (or send one to the next side with its
  button, or pick the side from its menu on a phone), or let Shuffle fill them in: _Random_, or
  _Spread by record here_, which deals players out by their K/D over the matches they finished on
  that server (smoothed, so a newcomer counts as about 1). Even up moves the fewest players that
  get the sides within one. Both keep clan tags together when that is ticked, and leave out the
  sides unticked _In shuffle_ (a closed faction). Nothing moves until Save, which moves the players
  one at a time, about three a second, without the kill, and says who was moved, who had left and
  who was on that side already; whoever was not moved stays in the plan. A Team balance rule keeps
  those moves, and evens the sides up again at the next match start as it always does.
- **Analytics**: the worker keeps what the game does not: players online over time, players per
  day and how many of them were new, how long sessions last, cash in play per faction, uptime,
  time per map, wins per team, busiest hours, player playtime and sessions, match history
  with results. Samples are written when something changes plus a heartbeat, and every figure is
  duration-weighted, so a faster cadence never distorts them.
- **Player dossiers**: click any player for their history across the organisation's servers
  (sessions, playtime, names used, K/D), the admin actions taken on them, shared notes and a
  watchlist, and, with a Steam key, their Steam persona, account age and VAC / game-ban record.
- **Connect-time risk**: an advisory score from the Steam Web API, bans on the org's other
  servers, lookalike names of banned players and the watchlist, shown next to each connected
  player. It sees what RCON exposes and nothing more: no aim, position or input telemetry.
- **Automation**: per-server triggers the worker evaluates on every observation, so a welcome
  whisper or a risk kick lands within a couple of seconds of the join. Every action goes through
  an outbox and is recorded as delivered, failed, skipped or unknown, and survives a restart in
  between. Each rule is dry-runnable against the last 24 hours before it is switched on: welcome
  whisper on join or once the player has picked a faction, a whisper on faction change, scheduled
  broadcasts, empty-server map reset, kick-on-connect for VAC bans, brand-new accounts or bans
  elsewhere in the org, a flag for players whose kill rate or headshot share is out of line, and a
  team balance that keeps the sides even without moving anyone mid-match, and can close one
  faction to play two teams.
- **Organisation ban and reserved lists**: ban a player across every server in the organisation
  at once, with a reason and an optional expiry; hand out reserved slots the same way. The worker
  keeps every server in line and shows where each entry stands; bans added outside the panel are
  left alone.
- **Discord mirror and status channels**: an org owner points a channel webhook at the audit trail
  and picks what to mirror (bans, commands, trigger actions, sign-ins…), per server if wanted. A
  webhook can also keep a live status card per server in its channel, edited in place by the
  worker: players online, map art, mode, a score bar per faction and who is on each side.
- **Everything the official console does**: status, scoreboard, kick/ban/kill/whisper/change-team,
  broadcasts, map override, next map, end/restart match, map rotation editing and saving, reserved
  slots, bans, score tick, sponsor image, a live cash-in-play chart for the current match, and the
  full `ServerSettings.ini` config document as a typed form (or the raw file) with validate/apply,
  revision conflict handling and copy/download.
- **A modifier on every map**: the Map rotation tab adds Infantry Only or Hardcore to every rotation
  entry whose map offers it, or takes it off them all, in one apply. It is there where the rotation
  is edited through the config document (every live build so far), so it needs Config & settings.
- **Group whispers**: one message to everyone on a faction, from the Overview's message box, or to
  the players ticked on the Players tab. The game has no route for it, so Warcon whispers each of
  them in turn and says who got it.
- **Demo mode**: a built-in mock game server so you can try everything before pointing it at a real one.

## How it works

```
browser ──HTTPS──▶ web (Bun + SvelteKit)            worker ──HTTP──▶ game server :7776 (WDRCON)
                     │  pages, /api/* JSON, Better Auth      │  observes every server on its tier
                     │  live view + SSE from the worker      │  (1–2 s watched/busy, 30 s idle)
                     │  commands → relay → worker's lane     │  sessions, triggers → outbox → delivery
                     └─ Postgres / TimescaleDB ◀─────────────┘  samples, matches, live snapshot, settings
```

One image, three roles: `web` serves the panel, `worker` owns every game request, `migrate`
applies the schema and exits. `WARCON_ROLE=all` (the default outside Compose) does all of it in
one process for the smallest install. Web and worker talk over a small HTTP relay guarded by
`RELAY_SECRET`; the worker holds a lease in the database so exactly one process observes, and
re-checks it inside every write.

The official console calls the game server straight from the browser over plain HTTP, so it cannot
be hosted on HTTPS and every admin needs the raw RCON password. Warcon keeps the password
server-side (AES-GCM encrypted), authenticates admins with its own accounts, checks the role for
every action, and writes an audit row before answering. Nobody reads the password back, owners
included, and changing a server's host, port or scheme asks for it again, since the stored one
would otherwise be sent to the new address.

## Deploy with Docker

New to this? [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md) walks through it step by step.

Prerequisites: Docker with Compose.

```bash
git clone <this repo> warcon && cd warcon
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set BETTER_AUTH_SECRET and ENCRYPTION_KEY to `openssl rand -base64 32` values,
#            POSTGRES_PASSWORD, and ORIGIN to the URL people will open (http://<host>:3000, or your https domain)
docker compose up -d
```

Compose starts `migrate` (runs once), `warcon` (the web), `worker` and `db` (TimescaleDB); set
`RELAY_SECRET` in `.env` to any long random string. The app reaches `db` through the
`PGHOST`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD` and `PGDATABASE` variables Compose sets, so `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`
can contain any characters. To use an external Postgres instead, set `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` (it
takes precedence over those) and delete the `db` service together with the `depends_on` block in
`docker-compose.yml`; install the `timescaledb` extension there before the first start if you want
the analytics samples compressed as they age (plain Postgres works too; the samples table then
grows uncompressed, about 1.5 MB per game server per day).

The Admin page's Overview shows the build each process runs, the version and the commit, so an
install on an old build is easy to spot. There is nothing to set: the build reads the commit from
the checkout. Only a build whose source arrives without `.git` needs it passed in, as the
`WARCON_COMMIT` build argument.

Open the URL. The first visit shows the **owner setup** form; after that it is a normal login. Then,
as owner:

1. **Orgs → New organisation**, or rename the **Default** organisation every install starts with.
2. **Servers → Add server**: name, host, port, scheme, RCON password. Use **Test** to check reach.
   The organisation's **Servers** tab then shows them side by side with the live view: reach, map,
   players, and who may open each.
3. **Orgs → your org → New invite link**: pick the role joiners get, copy the link into your
   Discord. People open it, sign in with Discord, and appear under **Members**, where you can adjust
   their per-server roles.

The database lives in the `warcon-db` volume; back it up with `pg_dump`. Migrations are applied
by the `migrate` container before web and worker start (a single `WARCON_ROLE=all` process applies
them itself); web and worker refuse to start while any are pending. Keep `ENCRYPTION_KEY` safe: losing it means re-entering every
server's RCON password. Never change it after servers are added unless you intend to re-enter them.

### Behind a reverse proxy or Cloudflare

Put Caddy, nginx, Traefik, or a Cloudflare Tunnel in front of port 3000 for TLS, then set in `.env`:

```
ORIGIN=https://rcon.example.com   # cookies become Secure, redirects and form posts use this
ADDRESS_HEADER=x-forwarded-for    # the header your proxy puts the client IP in; XFF_DEPTH=1 (default) reads the last hop it appended
```

`ADDRESS_HEADER` and `XFF_DEPTH` are read by SvelteKit's Node adapter, which resolves the client
address for login throttling and the rate limits (it is never stored). Use `x-real-ip` for nginx, `x-forwarded-for` for
Caddy and Traefik, `cf-connecting-ip` for a Cloudflare Tunnel. Only set it when the proxy is the only
way to reach the port; otherwise anyone can spoof their address and dodge the limits.

Have the proxy redirect plain `http://` to `https://` (Caddy does this by default; on Cloudflare turn on
**Always Use HTTPS**). A page served over http has an http origin, and every form post on it is then
rejected as cross-site against the https `ORIGIN`.

### Metrics (Prometheus)

Both processes export Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`, the web on its normal port and the worker
on `WORKER_PORT`, behind the `METRICS_TOKEN` bearer; the endpoint answers 404 until that is set.
Warcon ships no Prometheus or Grafana of its own: point the ones you already run at it. Everything
is counted in memory on paths that already run, never with a query per server, and the few gauges
that need a look at the database or the scheduler are read once per scrape.

```yaml
# prometheus.yml on your monitoring host
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: warcon-web
    authorization: { credentials: <METRICS_TOKEN> }
    static_configs: [{ targets: ['panel.example.com:443'] }]
    scheme: https
  - job_name: warcon-worker
    authorization: { credentials: <METRICS_TOKEN> }
    static_configs: [{ targets: ['10.0.0.5:7700'] }] # the worker's private address
```

With `WARCON_ROLE=all` one process serves both sets, so one job is enough. The web endpoint sits
on the panel's own URL, so it is reachable wherever the panel is. The worker's port is the relay
port: the Compose file keeps it inside the Compose network, so a Prometheus on another machine
cannot see it until you publish it on a private address (add `ports: ['10.0.0.5:7700:7700']` to
the `worker` service, never `0.0.0.0`), or run Prometheus on the same host and Compose network.
The exposition carries fleet-wide figures: keep the token out of URLs and never publish
`/metrics` without it.
[`monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json`](monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json) is a dashboard to import
into your Grafana (Dashboards → New → Import); it expects the two job names above and, for its
database panels, a [postgres_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus-community/postgres_exporter)
scraped as job `postgres`, which is optional.

### Roles

Every server belongs to an **organisation**. People are members of organisations, either as
**org owner** or **member**, and members get a per-server role. The **site owner** (the account
from first-run setup, plus anyone it promotes under Admin → Users) runs the whole panel.

A server role is a named set of **capabilities**. Every organisation starts with three, `viewer`,
`operator` and `admin`, holding what the table shows. Its owners can change any of them on the
org's **Roles** tab (a change applies at once to everyone holding the role), reset a built-in to
what it shipped with, and add roles of their own, say a `Trial staff` that may kick but not ban.
**Reorder** on the same tab sets the order of the roles (drag a row, or move it with its arrows),
which the tab's columns and every role picker follow; a new role goes in last. Org owners and the
site owner hold every capability on every server in scope.

View is what is happening on the server and nothing about how it is run. The config document, the
triggers, staff notes on players and the game's RCON log each need the capability that manages
them, in the panel and for API keys alike; where the server listens (its RCON host and port) and
the notes on the Servers page are shown to the organisation's owners only.

No role reads the server's credentials. The config document leaves the panel with the RCON
`Password`, its `PasswordHash` and the kill feed `Token` shown as `(hidden)`, for every role, org
owners and API keys included. Leave `(hidden)` as it is and validate and apply put the server's
current value back; type over it to change the value. A copied or downloaded document carries the
placeholder too, so it is not a backup of those three lines. Raw RCON does not serve `/v1/config`;
the `config`, `configValidate` and `configApply` actions are the way to the document. Nor does it
serve `/v1/audit`: the `serverLog` action does, with the peers' addresses blank for everyone but
the site owner, API keys included.

Beyond server roles, an **org owner** adds, edits and removes the org's servers, manages members,
roles, per-server grants and invite links and Discord webhooks, and sees the org's audit trail. The
**site owner** creates and deletes organisations, manages every account, and sees the whole trail.

Members see the audit trail for their own actions plus everything on servers where their role
includes _Audit trail_. Existing installs keep their access on upgrade: every grant is mapped to
the matching built-in role of its organisation. _Org lists_ has since been split into _Org ban
list_ and _Org reserved slots_, so an org can hand out one without the other: every role, and
every API key over the whole organisation, that held it was given both; a key limited to some
servers, which could never open the org lists, was given neither. _Kick, kill, move_ has since been
split into _Kick_, _Kill_ and _Move_: every role and API key that held it was given all three, and
its old id, `players.moderate`, is refused when a role or key is saved.

### Self-service sign-up

Invite links always let a newcomer create an account: with Discord or Steam (the provider's
identity becomes the account), with a passkey, or, behind a link, with a username and password
(8 sign-ups per IP address per half hour; add a [Cloudflare Turnstile](https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/)
widget with `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` and `TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY` to keep bots off the username forms).
With `ALLOW_ORG_SIGNUP=true`, `/sign-up` additionally
lets anyone create an organisation of their own and become its owner, up to three per person, and
**Discord** and **Steam** on the sign-in page create an account for a user who has none
and send them to `/sign-up`; the site owner still sees and can rename or delete every org. Leave
it off for a single-clan install.

### Sign-in methods and recovery

The panel holds no email address, so nobody is ever sent a reset link. Instead every account is
expected to be able to survive losing one thing. The rules, checked on the **Account** page:

- **Two independent ways in.** A passkey, a linked Discord or Steam account, a password with an
  authenticator app, and a saved recovery key each count as one.
- **A second factor on any password.** A password on its own is never enough; turn on the
  authenticator app (TOTP, with backup codes) or drop the password and rely on passkeys and
  providers. Passkeys and provider sign-ins are two factors by themselves and never ask for a code.
- **Owners hold a linked provider or a recovery key.** An organisation owner can reset a member's
  methods under Admin → Users, but nobody resets an owner, so an owner needs a way back in that
  does not depend on one device.

The **recovery key** is a 40-character secret shown once; the panel stores only its hash. Using it
at `/recover` signs the account in once, discards the key, and lands on the account page to set
things up again. New accounts start with a passkey or a provider (the password form sits behind a
link). Existing accounts keep working: a banner asks for the missing pieces. How hard the panel
pushes is the site owner's **Settings → Sign-in rules** choice: _Advise only_ (the default: the
banner and nothing more), _Require for privileged accounts_ (site owners, organisation owners and
anyone whose server role can ban, change config, run automation or use raw RCON must comply;
guests and viewers are left alone), or _Require for everyone_. Where required, an account that
still falls short after its grace period (14 days for owners, 30 for members, both editable,
counted from the first sign-in after this release) is limited to its account page until it does.

When every method is gone, whoever runs the box resets the account from a shell (the container
image has it too):

```sh
bun run auth:reset -- <username>           # local checkout
docker compose run --rm migrate bun ./build/reset-auth.js <username>   # Compose
```

It removes the authenticator app, passkeys and recovery key, keeps Discord and Steam links, signs
every session out, and prints a temporary password that must be changed at the next sign-in.

Passkeys need the panel to be served over `https` at the exact `ORIGIN` (the WebAuthn relying
party id is its hostname); `http://localhost` works for development. Steam sign-in uses Steam's
OpenID and needs no key; `STEAM_API_KEY` only improves the username and avatar of accounts it
creates. Better Auth's own `/api/auth/*` routes stay closed to browsers: passkey ceremonies go
through `/api/passkeys/*`, and codes, recovery keys and Steam through the panel's own pages.

### Player dossiers, risk and the watchlist

Every player name in the panel links to a dossier: sessions, playtime, seed time, kills and deaths
on each of the organisation's servers, the names they have used, every ban that holds them, the
admin actions taken on them (kicks, bans, whispers, trigger actions), notes admins have left, and a
watchlist flag with a reason. Notes and the watchlist are shared by every server in the
organisation; roles with _Notes & watchlist_ can write them, and a note can be deleted by its author
or a role with _Others' notes_. A [Discord webhook](#discord-webhooks) ticked for _Watched players
joining_ posts each time a watched player joins one of the organisation's servers.

The **bans** box lists every ban that holds the player on the servers you can open: the
organisation's list (once: it holds them on every server), each server's own list, and a ban the
game holds on its own list, with the reason and when it lifts. Who placed a panel ban is shown, as
on the Bans tab, to people who hold _Bans_ on that server or may edit the org's ban list (a ban on
the game's own list shows the name the game keeps, as the Bans tab does), and each ban has
an **Unban** for people who may lift it: _Bans_ there for a server's own list or the game's, _Org ban
list_ for the organisation's. **Ban…** opens the ban dialog whether or not the player is on: this
server only with _Bans_, every server with _Org ban list_, with a length and the organisation's
quick reasons. Whisper and Kick need the player on the server.

**Admin actions on this player** names each action and says what it was about: the reason a kick
or ban was given, what a whisper said, how long a ban or reserved slot lasts. A rule's row keeps
its own short line ("Kicked …: 3 team kills this match"), never the text a rule sent. The table
holds the newest 50 rows you may read in the audit trail; **All in the audit trail** opens them
all, with the trail's filters by action and by person.

With a [Seeding reward](#automation-triggers) switched on for the server, people with _Automation_
there see where the player stands with it: the seed time banked on that server over the rule's
window against the minutes it asks for and what is left, or the reserved slot they hold, which the
rule passes over them for. With seed time banked only once the server fills, a seed in progress
shows once it is banked.

On servers with the [kill feed](#kill-feed), the dossier also lists the names the feed showed for
the player that were not the one the server listed them under, newest first: _In the kill feed as_.
The game's player list keeps the name a player joined with (a clan tag changed mid-game aside), so a
player who renames mid-game to hide, often as another player, shows only there. A name that was
another player's on the server at the time is in brass and opens that player's page; the five
newest show, the rest a press away, with a link to the player's kills. A name they also played under
as their own there is left out. Past players and the
organisation's Players find a player by those names too, and show which one the search found. Only
the servers the reader can open are read. The names are recorded as kills come in, kept for good,
and filled once from the kill history, in the background, after the upgrade that adds them.

With a Steam key, the Players tab shows a player's Steam name under an in-game name that does not
already hold it (a streamer's hidden name, say), and its filter finds players by that name too.

With `STEAM_API_KEY` set, the dossier also shows the Steam persona, account age (public profiles
only), VAC and game bans, refreshed daily and on demand, and what its friends list shows, looked
at weekly. The **advisory risk score** is worked out when someone looks, for that reader: a ban on
another server, or games recorded there, count only if the reader can open that server. A ban
counts whether the panel placed it (a server's own list, or the organisation's, which holds the
player everywhere and so counts only on the dossier) or the game holds it on its own list. The score
is bounded to 0–100. Recent bans weigh more than old ones; multiple banned friends, a private
profile or friends list, local bans, name resemblance, and the watchlist add evidence. Extreme
win rate, K/D, and headshot percentage across recorded games add smaller weights only after
minimum match/kill counts. Headshot percentage uses kill-feed games only; the other totals use the
panel's match and session history. A _Kick on connect risk_ rule that kicks at a risk score judges
everyone on the server against the whole organisation. Its line in the audit trail and on Discord
says _banned on another server of this organisation_ or _Name resembles a banned player_, never
which server, why, or whom: the server's staff need not be able to open that server, and its
dossier shows the details to people who can.
At most 200 Steam friends are checked per account, and a partial count is labelled as such;
the friends lookups keep to a fifth of the 100,000 calls a day Steam allows a key.
Steam provides no documented profile-comments read endpoint to this panel, so comments are not
scored. Missing data is not treated as clean data or as proof of cheating. The score is a pointer
for an admin to look closer, not a verdict: the RCON API exposes no aim, position or input data.

### Organisation ban and reserved lists

Each organisation keeps a **ban list** and a **reserved-slot list** in the panel, under the
**Ban list** and **Reserved slots** tabs of the organisation page, and pushes them to every one of
its servers. Each server's own **Bans** and **Reserved slots** tabs show what that server holds,
mark the entries the organisation put there, and link to the organisation lists. The Reserved
slots tab is a roster: who holds a slot, whether they are playing right now, the note and expiry
on their entry, and how many player slots the server holds back for them. Its form reserves a
slot **on this server only**, with a note and an expiry, through a reserved-slot list of the
server's own: the panel applies it at once and withdraws it when the expiry comes, and the
roster marks these _here_. The organisation's Reserved
slots tab has the same shape across every server: the roster with who is playing where, how far
the list has been applied on each server, and the form that hands out a slot everywhere. Ban a player from the
Players tab or a dossier and choose _every server in the organisation_ (the default, when you may
edit the org list) or _this server only_. A ban on this server only goes on a ban list of the
server's own, marked _here_ on its Bans tab with the reason, who placed it and when it lifts. The
panel enforces its bans itself: the worker removes a banned player the moment it sees them on
the server, with the organisation's ban message, and writes nothing to the game's own ban list or
files. Select a ban the panel holds and choose **Edit**
to change its reason or expiry; who placed it and when stay as they are. Org owners can edit
both org lists; anyone whose role on one of the org's servers includes _Org ban list_ or _Org
reserved slots_ can edit that list, and either one opens the org's Players and Servers tabs.
_Bans_ on a server covers its own ban list and _Reserved slots_ its own slots. A ban can carry a
reason and an expiry, a reserved slot a note and an expiry. Everyone who can open the server sees who is banned, why and until when, so
write a reason as something the player could be told; who placed a ban is shown to people who hold
_Bans_ on the server or may edit the org's ban list, and the note on a reserved slot to people who
hold _Reserved slots_ on the server or may edit the org's reserved-slot list.

An org owner can set a **ban message** on the Ban list tab: the text a banned player is shown,
built from the reason and facts about the ban, for example
`{reason} | Expires {expires} | Appeal: discord.gg/yours | {uid}`. The placeholders are `{reason}`,
`{duration}` (`Perm`, `7d`, `36h`), `{expires}` and `{banned}` (UTC, `never` for a permanent ban),
`{uid}` (a short id shown in the ban list's ID column and found by its filter) and `{admin}` (the
name of whoever placed the ban: the game shows its ban list to everyone who can open the server,
so use it only if that name may be public). The message applies to org bans and to bans on one
server's own list, from the moment it is saved; the list keeps the bare reason, and a ban already
on a server keeps the text it was placed with, also when its reason or expiry is edited later.
The default, `{reason}`, sends the reason alone.

An org owner can also set the ban dialog's **quick reasons** on the Ban list tab: the buttons under
Reason when anyone in the organisation places a ban, from any page. Each has a short name for the
button, the reason it fills in and, if you like, a length (permanent, 1, 3, 7, 14 or 30 days) that
it sets in Expires, shown beside its name (`7d`, `Perm`); one with no length leaves Expires as the
admin has it. An organisation keeps up to 20, in the order the buttons show. Until its owners save
a list of their own it offers the six built in (Cheating, Team killing, Toxic behaviour, Racism /
hate speech, Ban evasion, Griefing), and **Reset to the built-in six** puts those back. The quick
reasons reach only people who can place a ban there (_Bans_ on the server, or the org's ban list),
and ban list editors who are not owners see them on the Ban list tab without changing them. Bans
already placed keep their reasons.

Each entry shows where it stands on every server: **applied** by the panel, **pending** the next
sync, **failed** (hover for the server's answer), or **local**. Local means the player was already
banned (or reserved) on that server by someone working outside the panel. The panel never removes
what it did not add, so removing an org entry lifts it only where the panel applied it, and a
local ban stays until an owner imports it into the org list or unbans it on that server.

Bans and reserved slots that your servers already hold show up on the list pages as candidates to
**import**: an owner reviews them, and importing puts them on the org list, marks them as managed
on the servers that have them, and applies them to the rest. On a server's Bans tab a local ban can be
promoted the same way (owners), or added to the org list while this server's own copy stays local
(ban list editors). A dossier shows the player's slot on the org's reserved-slot list to that
list's editors, who can hand one out or withdraw it there; an org ban shows in its bans box, where
the ban list's editors can lift it, and its Ban… places one.

A ban or reserved slot with an **expiry** is lifted by the panel when the time comes: the entry
moves to the list's history as expired; an expired ban stops being enforced at once, and an
expired slot is removed from every server the panel applied it to at the next sync. With
**Members get a reserved slot** on (an owner's switch on the Reserved slots tab), every member of
the organisation who linked a SteamID on their Account page is reserved a slot on all its servers,
skipped while the org has them banned. A **Seeding reward** rule (see [Automation](#automation-triggers))
hands out expiring entries the same way, on the seeded server's own list or the organisation's,
to players who stayed while a server was low; the entry names the rule that added it. A **Kill
distance watch** that bans adds a ban the same way, on the server's own list or the organisation's,
for good or until an expiry, and it is lifted there like any other.

Bans are enforced by the panel, not by the game. The worker holds each server's bans (the
organisation's list and the server's own) and, every time it looks at the server's players (every
two seconds on a server with people on it, up to thirty on an empty one), removes anyone who is
banned, showing them the ban message as it reads at that moment. A ban, an unban, an edit or an
expiry therefore takes effect at once and on every server, whether or not the player is connected,
and no settings file is touched. Each removal is in the audit trail under `system` as
`ban.enforce`. Two things follow. Bans only hold while Warcon is running and can reach the server:
if you stop the panel, nobody is kept out. And bans the game holds in its own list (placed with
the in-game console, another RCON tool, the `ban` action of the API, or by an older Warcon) are
not the panel's: the Bans tab shows them as _local_ with **Unban**, the panel never adds to or
lifts them, and on hosts that keep them in `ServerSettings.ini` they come back at a restart until
you take them out of the file. To move one to the panel, ban the player in the panel and remove
the local ban.

Reserved slots are synced to the game twice over: right away when a list is edited (the toast
says on how many servers the change landed, and which are unreachable and will be retried), and on
every poll, where the poller re-applies anything missing. A reserved slot is a queue skip:
the game takes the list at any length, and `MaxReservedSlots` only sets how many player slots
are held back for the people on it (a 100-slot server with 2 held back reports 98 to the public;
the panel shows the split). Live builds have no reserved-slot routes,
so on those the panel writes `DefaultReservedPlayerIds` in the config document instead (one
revision-checked apply per change), as the official console does. Every run that changes something, or fails,
is in the audit trail under `system` as `lists.sync`, and reaches Discord webhooks that mirror
bans. **Sync now** on a list page pushes everything on demand.

### Automation (triggers)

The **Automation** tab on each server holds rules the poller evaluates on every sample. Admins
create them; every action they take is in the audit trail under the `trigger` category with the
rule that fired, and can be mirrored to Discord. A rule acts with nobody at the controls, so
saving or dry-running one needs, besides _Automation_, the capability for what it does: _Chat_ for
the rules that message players (a Kill distance watch that warns among them), _Match control_ for
the map reset, _Kick_ for the rules that kick, the Kill rate watch, the Name change watch and a
Kill distance watch that flags or kicks, _Move_ for Team balance (with
_Chat_ as well when it whispers), _Kill_ for AFK protection (with _Chat_ as well when it
broadcasts) and for a Kill distance watch that kills (with _Chat_ as well, for the whisper that
comes with it), for a Kill distance watch that bans _Bans_ (on this server) or _Org
ban list_ (on every server), and for the Seeding reward _Reserved slots_ or _Org reserved slots_ (see
its row). A custom role or API key with _Automation_ alone can read the rules and
delete them.

| Empty-server map reset | After the server has been empty for N minutes on a different map or mode, sets the chosen map as next and ends the match (or requests it directly when there is no rotation).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Kick on connect risk   | Kicks players who match rules: VAC ban or game ban (optionally only within the last N days), Steam account younger than N days (optionally private profiles too), banned on another server in the org, or on the watchlist; or whose advisory risk score is at or above a set number from 1 to 100 (medium starts at 20, high at 50; the players table badges 20 and up). Joiners and players reconnecting are judged at once, and everyone on is judged again every minute (a player whose kick did not land, every five). Nobody is judged until the server's reserved slots have been read. Reserved-slot players can be spared.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Name filter            | Kicks joiners whose name breaks the rule, or with _Alert only_ just records them (audit trail and Discord). A character policy: any, Latin letters (keeps José and Müller, optionally with Cyrillic, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, Devanagari, Chinese, Japanese or Korean beside them) or ASCII only; digits, spaces and keyboard punctuation always pass, emoji and symbols only when allowed, and a name can be required to hold N letters. Blocked words: a built-in English list of slurs and hate terms, your own words (up to 200) and exceptions for names that would match but are fine. Words are caught through case, leetspeak, look-alike letters, stretching and spelling out (`n.a.z.i`). The kick reason's `{why}` says what kind of fault it was, never the word. Reserved-slot players can be spared. Checked at the join and again whenever the name changes, clan tag included: the game can show the tag a moment after the player is in. A kick rule also checks a player who reconnects. Its dry run checks everyone who has played on the server, under each name they used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Name change watch      | Flags a player who changes their name mid-game, or with _Kick_ kicks them (a reserved slot can be flagged instead). The game's player list keeps the name a player joined with (a clan tag changed mid-game aside), while the [kill feed](#kill-feed) names both players of every kill as the others see them: each time a player kills or dies, the rule holds the name the feed shows against the one the list has for them. Counts every change, or only a change to the name of another player on the server. Names are compared as they read: case, spacing, punctuation, symbols, invisible characters, look-alike letters, I/l/1 and 0/O are no disguise, nor is a clan tag in brackets dropped or added to a copied name (names of five letters or more); a player's own name with a clan tag put on, taken off or swapped is not a change. Acts at N changes within M minutes (up to two hours): an alert flags a player once a window, a kick acts at every count, and a kicked player who comes back under the taken name goes again. In the kick reason `{name}` is the name the feed showed and `{previous}` the one they are listed under. Flags go to the audit trail and Discord with the name they are listed under and their SteamID (the post opens the player's page). Changing or switching it off drops what it had queued. Needs the kill feed; the worker's memory of names starts over when it restarts. The dry run holds the day's kills against the names of the sessions open at each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| High ping kick         | Kicks a player whose reported ping remains above a configurable limit for a configurable number of seconds. Normal or unavailable ping, leaving, or interrupted player-list polling resets the timer. Historical ping is not stored, so this rule cannot be replayed in a dry run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Team kill limit        | Whispers a player from N team kills in one match, and kicks them at M; leaving and rejoining does not start the count over. Team kills by what the rule leaves out are not counted and still show as team kills everywhere else: barbed wire unless unticked (a player who runs into a teammate's wire is reported as killed by whoever built it), and any other buildable or placed charge ticked. Needs the [kill feed](#kill-feed); acted on as each kill arrives, not per poll.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Kill rate watch        | Flags a player, never kicks, when their kills with hand-held weapons in the last N minutes reach a count, or their share of headshots over those kills reaches a percentage once they have at least M; vehicles, their guns and buildables are not counted. The flag goes to the audit trail and the Discord mirror (the post opens the player's page in the panel), and the same player is flagged again only after a cooldown. Needs the [kill feed](#kill-feed), which has no position or aim, so a flag is a reason to look, not proof. The windows are kept in the worker's memory and start over when it restarts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Kill distance watch    | Acts on a player whose kills with the chosen weapons come from at least N metres away, M of them in one match: a defibrillator or a fist reaches a few metres, so the same kill from across the map is a player the game did not stop. The weapons are offered in three lists, as the kill feed names them: hand-held (a new rule starts with the defibrillator; charges that are placed and set off from anywhere are not offered), the vehicles' guns (a Humvee's M249 or minigun turret), and the vehicles themselves (a roadkill, or a vehicle blown up with its crew inside). From 0 m every kill with them counts, one the feed sends without a distance too, so a server can act on each kill with a weapon or a vehicle it does not allow: an infantry-only server can act on whoever kills from a Humvee's turret. It flags them (audit trail and the Discord mirror, whose post opens the player's page), warns them (the rule's text whispered to them, mirrored the same way; a blank text says the weapon is not allowed on this server), kills them and whispers them the rule's text (so a server can answer each Humvee kill with the killer's death: the feed only reports kills, so a player who drives one without killing anybody is not seen), kicks them, or bans them for N days or for good on this server's own ban list or the organisation's, like a ban by hand: every server the ban reaches takes its lists again at once and removes them at its next look, and the ban is lifted from the list. A shorter ban already on that list is made to last as long. A killed, kicked or banned player is left alone for a minute while that lands, so a roadkill of three is one kill; one who does it again after that, that match, is acted on at their next such kill. A flag or a warning comes again in the same match only after the rule's cooldown, and at their first such kill in the next. A warning, a kill and a kick need the player still on when they are sent, and a kill goes within half a minute or not at all (one sent later would land on them doing something else, or on the next map). A kill the game refuses (no living character, presumably) still sends the whisper; with that refused too, the action fails. Two rules that kill on the same weapon each kill. To warn first and kick after, make two rules on the same weapons, the kick's count higher. Needs the [kill feed](#kill-feed), whose distance is between killer and victim; acted on as each kill arrives, and counted per match as the Team kill limit counts. A kill that comes within a minute of the killer's own death is not counted: the player is dead, so it is a round already on its way, and the game credits a vehicle's shell that lands after the vehicle was destroyed to the gunner's own weapon, from wherever the gunner is by then (an M4 kill from 2,300 m). The audit trail notes each kill left out this way, with how long after the death it came; Discord is not told. Editing, switching off or deleting the rule starts the counts over and drops what it had queued. The counts are kept in the worker's memory and start over when it restarts. The rule believes the feed: whoever holds a server's feed token can make it act, so keep bans on every server for rules on servers whose host you trust. |
| Team balance           | Keeps the open sides within a set number of players of each other (3 by default), closes one faction, or both. Nobody who is playing is moved mid-match: balancing places a player when they arrive (on the side they picked while that keeps within the gap, else on the lighter one), puts back a player who switches onto a side more than the gap bigger than the one they left, and evens everyone up when a new match starts (a map change or the scores starting over). Whoever is on when the rule is switched on or changed, after the worker restarts, when the server comes back from being out of reach, or after two minutes (three looks, at a slower player list cadence) without a look at the player list, counts as placed until the next match, so it never reshuffles the match it walks in on; starting over also forgets who was told and the asks. The side a player was placed on is kept for ten minutes away, so leaving and rejoining on the bigger side is put back too. Optional: keep clan tags together (a short tag in brackets at the front of the name; a preference that yields to the gap; when a new match is evened up, players whose clan is mostly on the other side move first, then those with the fewest clanmates beside them), and SteamIDs it never moves (staff who switch sides themselves). A move made from the Players tab or the API is kept, not put back; one made anywhere else (the game's own console, another balancer) is put back like a switch, so run no other balancer beside it. Right after a match end, placing waits up to 30 seconds from the players' return (the list is empty while the next map loads) while a quarter or more of them have not picked a side, and whom it moves is not decided by list order. Everyone on the closed faction is moved to the smaller other side (or their clan's, within the gap). Every move is the game's own move, sent without the kill the Players tab's Move adds. Moves go out a few at a time as the player list refreshes, so a full server's sort takes about half a minute; moves in flight count toward their side, and one not seen landed within 30 seconds is decided again; a queued move goes out only while the rule still holds that decision, so a retry, a new match or a person moving the player drops it. A player who switches onto the bigger side is put back every time; a player asked to move three times in ten minutes for any other reason, or put back three times without it taking, is left where they are until the ten minutes pass. Watch only lists each move it would make under Actions, as skipped, and moves nobody. Optional names for the sides (e.g. Red and Green) and a whisper, `{team}`, sent once to each player it moves (again after two hours away). One rule per server; changing or switching it off drops its queued moves. Its moves reach Discord only when they fail. What it remembers is the worker's: a restart forgets the moves in flight, who was told, the asks and the sides. A rule saved before balancing existed only closes its faction until balancing is ticked. Nothing to dry-run: faction moves are not in the session history; use Watch only.                                                                                                                       |
| Match broadcast        | Announces the result when a match ends and the map as the next one starts, either message optional, with at least N players on (the game shows nobody on while the next map loads, so the announcement waits up to three minutes for the players to be back). A match ends when the map changes or the faction scores fall back to zero (a faction reached the cap, or an admin ended the round; live builds send no score cap or match clock, so Warcon assumes the game's default of 100), so `{faction}` is whoever led at that moment, tied factions named together. Besides the server's placeholders, `{score}` and `{scores}` of the match that ended, `{previous}` (its map), and from the players' lines of it `{mvp}` (the most kills, tied players named together) and `{top}` (the top three with their kills). Sent one poll after the round ends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Seeding reward         | Time a player spends on with at most N players counts as seed time, by default banked only once the server has filled (a count the rule sets, else the limit the server reports) with the player still on, so staying until the threshold and leaving, or a few minutes on an empty server, earns nothing (a switch on the rule counts every low minute instead); M minutes of it over the sessions that ended in the last D days earns a reserved slot for E days, with an optional whisper: on this server only (its own reserved-slot list, which needs the Reserved slots capability) or on every server in the organisation (the org list, which needs Org reserved slots), chosen on the rule. The seeded server applies it at once and, for an org-wide slot, the other servers at their next sync; it lapses on its own and can be earned again; players who already hold a slot here are skipped. Seed time is kept on each session, so the dossier (a total, per server and per session, and the player's progress toward the reward for _Automation_ holders), the leaderboard's Seed time column and the dry run show it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| AFK protection         | While the server seeds (someone on, fewer than the rule's count, 20 by default, and no side has scored), kills everyone on every N minutes (3 by default, 2 to 10), so the game's idle kick, which also runs while a server waits for its players, does not remove the seeders. The panel cannot tell who is idle, so players are killed too. Set the count no higher than the players the server's match starts at. A side scoring or the count being reached turns it off until the server has sat empty for 10 minutes or the game restarts, so a dip below the count mid-match, or the empty list of a map change, never starts it again; switched off and on, it starts from what the server shows then, so switching it on during a match nobody has scored in yet takes that match for seeding until the first score. Switching it off drops a round not yet sent. Its row says whether it is active or paused, and why. Optional broadcasts after each round and once when the match it kept the seeders for goes live (`{goal}` is the count it turns off at). A round is one action in the trail, kept off Discord unless it fails; it goes only within 30 seconds of being decided, while the last look still showed the server seeding, and players who left since are passed over. One rule per server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

**Dry run** replays the last 24 hours of the server's own history (joins, player counts, empty
stretches, cached Steam data) against a rule and lists what it would have done, so you can tune a
rule before enabling it. Joins are detected one poll apart, so a welcome arrives `POLL_SECONDS`
after someone connects, or after they pick a faction when the rule is set to wait for that (players
choose a side after joining, so a whisper on join can land while they are still in the menu); the
first poll after a restart or an outage never fires join rules, since everyone present looks like a
joiner then.

#### Placeholders

Every message and kick reason a rule sends can carry placeholders, filled as it goes out, in any
case; the editor's chips insert them at the caret and list any the message will not fill. Every
message has the server's; one to or about a player (the Welcome and Faction change whispers, the
Team kill whisper, the Team balance and Seeding reward whispers, and every kick or ban reason) has
the player's and their stats as well. A placeholder with nothing to fill in a message (a player's in
a broadcast) is left empty; anything else in braces is sent as typed.

| Placeholders | What they say                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

So `Welcome {player}: {kills} kills here, {org_kills} on all our servers` reaches a regular as
`Welcome [ABC] Night Owl: 1234 kills here, 2000 on all our servers`. The stats are read only for a
message that uses them, once per player each time it goes out; should the read fail, the message
goes with `…` in their place. What became of a rule's whisper or kick is told in the panel's own
words under Recent actions, in the audit trail and on Discord (`Whispered [ABC] Night Owl.`,
`Refused: the player is not on the server.`), never the game's, so what it tells a player reaches
that player alone. A dry run shows `…` for the stats and for whatever else it does not replay.

### Kill feed

WARDOGS can push every kill to an HTTP endpoint: with `[WDServerFeed] Url` and `Token` set in
`ServerSettings.ini`, the game process POSTs each kill (killer, victim, weapon or vehicle,
distance, headshot and other context) a second or two after it happens. Warcon is that endpoint.
On the server's **Config** tab an org owner clicks **Configure**: Warcon mints a token,
writes both keys into the config document and applies; the game reads them at its next restart
(its own 24-hour one, or a manual restart). `Url` is the panel's origin alone: the game
appends `/api/ingest/events` to it by itself. The card shows when the last batch arrived, so a
config that did not take is visible.

What the feed adds: a live kill feed on the server's Overview tab, a **Kills** tab with the whole
history (filter by killer, victim, either side, weapon or vehicle, kind of kill and minimum
distance, with a count, older pages and new kills arriving live; the filter lives in the URL, so a
view can be shared), a **Combat** section on Analytics (kills per bucket, weapons, longest kills,
top killers with headshot share and team kills), a Combat card on every player dossier (weapons,
most-killed, nemeses, recent kills and deaths), the names players showed in it that were not their
own (on their dossiers and in the Players searches), and the team-kill trigger. Team kills are
inferred: the feed carries no factions, so Warcon uses the factions it observed for both players
at that moment. Kills are history and are
never pruned (a TimescaleDB hypertable with compression where the extension is installed). The
demo server feeds itself once its feed is turned on.

The feed identifies its server by the token alone (the body's `serverId` changes with every
reboot), so each server has its own. The token is stored encrypted, like the RCON password, and
shown to org owners only. `POST /api/ingest/events` is the one `/api` route that takes neither a
session nor an API key, and it is exempt from the CSRF header for the same reason a bearer is.
Configs written by earlier versions hold `Url=<origin>/api/feed/events`, which the game turns into
a path Warcon does not serve. Click **Configure** again (the game reads the new `Url` at its next
restart), or have the proxy in front of the panel rewrite `/api/feed/events/api/ingest/events` to
`/api/ingest/events` until then. It has to be a rewrite, not a redirect: the game follows a 301 or
302 as a GET, which the feed refuses.

### Discord webhooks

A webhook is one Discord channel, and each one carries what is ticked for it. On the
organisation's overview an owner adds channel webhooks (in Discord: channel settings →
Integrations → Webhooks → copy URL) and chooses what to mirror: bans (including org list changes), other game commands, trigger
actions, player notes and watchlist changes, management changes, sign-ins, team kills from the
[kill feed](#kill-feed), watched players joining (with why they are watched, a poll after they
connect; the post opens their page in the panel); for every server or a subset. A separate team-kill channel is a second
webhook with only that box ticked; the server's **Settings** tab connects one in a click. Events are batched into one message per burst, and the URL
(which lets anyone post to the channel) is stored encrypted with `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and never shown
again. **Test** posts a message right away; delivery failures show on the org page.

Trigger actions can be narrowed to some kinds of rule: untick _Every kind of rule_ under them and
tick the kinds, grouped as on the Automation tab, so a channel for kicks and bans leaves out the
welcome whispers and scheduled broadcasts. A rule added later posts to every webhook that carries
its kind. Team balance and AFK protection post only what fails; the audit trail keeps every action
whatever goes to Discord.

Posts carry the name and picture the webhook has in Discord (the channel's settings →
Integrations → Webhooks). A status card keeps the name it was posted under: after renaming the
webhook, delete the card and Warcon posts it again under the new name.

A webhook can also keep a **live status card** for each server it covers (tick _Keep status
cards in the channel_ on the org page, or open the server's **Settings** tab, paste a webhook and
tick the card, team kills, or both; pin what it posts). Three card styles: **banner** (the default) with the wide map art and a
column of players per faction, **compact** with a map thumbnail, faction counts and the top
three, and **scoreboard** with one ranked table across the factions. The worker edits each card
in place; the banner shows: players online out of the slots
with a bar, map, lighting, mode and zone, a ten-square score bar per faction in the faction's
colour racing to the cap (the card's own colour bar follows the leader), match time, three columns of who is on each side with kills and deaths,
the wide map art, and a relative "updated" stamp Discord keeps current on its own. An unreachable
server shows red with the error and when it was last seen. Edits go out when something changed,
at least 30 seconds apart (longer when many servers share one webhook), plus a refresh every five
minutes, inside Discord's webhook limit. A card someone deleted from the channel is posted again;
pausing the webhook, switching the option off or changing the URL removes the cards, and a server
the webhook stops covering loses its card. Map art and the icon need `ORIGIN` to be https for the
pictures to show.

Each webhook sets how often its cards are edited (**refresh**, 30 seconds to 5 minutes, one
minute by default; the spacing that keeps a shared webhook under Discord's limit still applies
on top) and which **links** its cards carry: the server's public status page, its public
leaderboard, and the panel. The card's title opens the first link and the rest sit on a line
under the body. A public link goes out only while that page is on for the server (see
[Public pages](#public-pages)), so a card never sends people to the sign-in wall; the panel link
is off by default, for staff channels. The server's **Settings** tab has these controls next to
the card style, with the public page switches under them.

### JSON webhooks

For your own systems (a memberships database, a donor bot), an org owner adds a **JSON webhook**
on the organisation's overview (ten at most): an HTTPS address Warcon POSTs signed JSON to for each
event ticked on it, for every server or a subset. The one event so far is a
[Seeding reward](#automation-triggers) grant, sent once the slot is on the list:

```json
{
	"event": "seed_reward.granted",
	"id": "seed_reward.granted:0b6f3c2e-5d8a-4c17-9e42-7a1d6b3f8c90",
	"at": "2026-09-25T21:14:03.120Z",
	"org": { "id": "…", "name": "Example Clan" },
	"server": { "id": "…", "name": "Example Clan #1" },
	"player": { "steamId": "76561198100000101", "name": "Ghostpepper" },
	"slot": { "scope": "server", "expiresAt": "2026-10-02T21:14:03.120Z", "days": 7 },
	"rule": { "id": "…", "name": "Seeding reward" },
	"seedMinutes": 64
}
```

Every event starts with `event`, `id` and `at`; `id` is unique per event (its name and what it is
about) and stays the same on every attempt. `slot.scope` is `server` for a slot on that server's own
list and `org` for one on every server of the organisation. **Send test** posts a `ping` event with
`event`, `id`, `at` and `org`.

Every request carries `X-Warcon-Event`, `X-Warcon-Delivery` (the event's `id`) and
`X-Warcon-Signature: t=<unix seconds>,v1=<hex>`, where `v1` is the HMAC-SHA256 of `<t>.<body>`,
the body exactly as received, under the webhook's **signing secret**. The secret is shown once,
when the webhook is added (Edit can make a new one); check every request with it:

```js
import { createHmac, timingSafeEqual } from 'node:crypto';

function fromWarcon(rawBody, header, secret, toleranceS = 300) {
	const { t, v1 } = Object.fromEntries(header.split(',').map((kv) => kv.split('=')));
	if (!t || !v1 || Math.abs(Date.now() / 1000 - Number(t)) > toleranceS) return false;
	const want = createHmac('sha256', secret).update(`${t}.${rawBody}`).digest('hex');
	return want.length === v1.length && timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(want), Buffer.from(v1));
}
```

A 2xx answer is a delivery. No answer within five seconds, a 429 or a 5xx is sent again after 1, 5
and 30 minutes, then 2, 6, 12 and 24 hours; any other answer is final, and redirects are not
followed. After the last wait (about two days in all) the POST is given up and its webhook paused:
what was waiting for it is skipped, and nothing more is queued for it until an owner enables it
again. A webhook is also paused when whoever added it stops being an owner (removed, made a member,
or their account disabled or deleted). POSTs go out on a queue of their own, oldest first and one at
a time per webhook, and while one waits for its retry the webhook's others wait behind it, so a
receiver that is slow or down never holds up another webhook or the servers' own automation.
Delivery is at least once: after a timeout, or a panel restart in the middle of a send, the same
`id` can arrive twice, so dedupe on it. The address must be https and public: a private-network
address is for the site owner only (as a game server is) and a link-local one for nobody, checked
when it is saved and again before every send. The address and the secret are stored encrypted with
`ENCRYPTION_KEY`; the panel shows the address's host, when the last delivery went through and the
last result as a status code or a short reason, never what the receiver answered.

### Leaderboards and careers

Every server page has a **Leaderboards** tab: a board over this server or every server of the
organisation you can see, ranked by kills, deaths, K/D, kills per hour of playtime, playtime,
seed time (time on with the server low, as a [Seeding reward](#automation-triggers) counts it),
matches played, wins, win rate, cash or cash per minute of playtime, over a [season](#seasons), 7,
30 or 90 days or all time,
paged, with sortable headers. A **playtime floor** (an hour by default) keeps a ten-minute visit off the top of the
K/D board. Every stat is summed from the player's line of each match: the worker records one
row per player per match with the game's own kill and death counters over that match, the
player's time on and side, the change in their cash, and, on servers with a [kill feed](#kill-feed),
the feed's headshots, team kills, suicides, vehicle kills, longest shot and best kill and death
streaks. A match counts once it has ended (the match in progress is on the live page), and the
result (win, loss, draw) is read from the match's winner and final scores against the side the
player played; a match with no winner and nobody scoring, or one abandoned by a restart, has no
result. Playtime and seed time come from player sessions; kills per hour and cash per minute leave
seed time out; cash is summed over sessions, each banked across its matches like kills, so money
spent in a match lowers it. Cash per minute divides that cash by the whole time of the sessions it
came from: a session that began before a range or season counts all of its cash there, so all of
its time too, though Playtime shows only the time inside. Names link to the dossier.
A page of a board is read at most once a minute for the same servers and settings, so a match
that just ended can take up to a minute to appear (a stats purge shows at once). All time is read
from each player's totals per server, which the database keeps as sessions close and matches end,
plus the sessions still open; 7, 30 and 90 days from the same totals kept per UTC day, plus the
part of the range's first day and the sessions still open, so a range still starts to the second
(now minus 7 days), not at a midnight.

#### Seasons

A board shows one season at a time, or a range: the **Showing** menu above it lists the official
WARDOGS seasons, the organisation's own, and the 7, 30 and 90-day and all-time ranges. A season
is a name and a start, and runs until the next season of its kind starts. The official ones ship
with Warcon, each from the moment it launched: Season 1 from the early-access release on
10 September 2026, Season 2 from 15 October 2026 at 16:00 UTC. A new one is added when Bulkhead
announces it, and starts on its real date even when it is added late. An org owner adds the
organisation's own on its **Seasons** tab, each from midnight UTC on a day still to come; a
season that has started can be renamed but not moved or deleted, so its standings stay put, and
to end one early you start the next. Nothing is reset or deleted: a season's board is a window
over the history Warcon keeps anyway, so a past season's board is still there and read-only by
nature.

The Seasons tab also sets what the organisation's boards **open on**, in the panel and on the
public pages: the current official season (the default), the organisation's current season (the
official one while none of its own runs), the last 30 days, or all time. Anyone looking can pick
another season or range from the menu. A season still running reads like a range, up to now. A
finished one reads up to its end, shows no Last seen column, and has its **winners** above the
board: the top three on kills, K/D (at least ten matches in the season), playtime and wins. A
match counts in the season it ended in. Playtime counts the time inside the season: a session
still going when a season ends gives it the time up to the end, and its seed time and cash count
where it ends, as they do for the ranges. Cash per minute follows the cash: such a session's time
goes with it to the season it ended in.

The Seasons tab also picks the **public board columns**: an owner unticks the columns the
organisation's public boards leave out (each server's and the organisation's), and sees the header
row visitors will get. Rank, player and kills always show, since a board opens ranked by kills; a
link that sorts by a column left out ranks by kills instead. Every column shows until an owner
changes it, and a column added to the board later shows too. This tidies the page and hides
nothing: the panel's board and its export keep every column, and the board's JSON every number.

**Export CSV** on the tab downloads the board as it is set (scope, range, sort, playtime floor),
from the top and every page of it, up to 10,000 players: rank, SteamID, name, playtime and seed
time in minutes, kills, deaths, K/D, kills per hour, the feed's columns, matches, wins, losses,
draws, win rate, cash, cash per minute and when last seen. Names that start like a spreadsheet formula are written
as text. The file is UTF-8; Excel shows a 17-digit SteamID rounded unless that column is
imported as text.

Each dossier has a **Career** section: rank on the all-time kills board for this server and the
organisation, the current win or loss streak, matches with wins, losses and draws, K/D, kills per
minute, headshot rate and best streak, the organisation's last ten seasons (the player's matches,
results, kills, deaths and K/D in each, and for a finished season the places they won on this
server's board, also shown as badges at the top), a table per map and per faction (matches,
wins, K/D), and the last ten matches with map, faction, result, time on, kills, deaths and the
change in cash, each opening its match page. Everything is read at page load; the ranks from each
player's totals per server, the matches from the player's own rows.

Every server page has a **Matches** tab: the match history, newest first, with the map, when it
started, how long it ran, the winner with the final scores (or "abandoned" for a match a restart
closed without a result) and how many played. A match that has ended opens to its page: the
final scores, the score of each faction over the match (from the analytics samples), awards
judged at read time (most kills, best K/D at ten kills or more, longest shot, best streak,
richest match; none for a match under twenty minutes), a sortable scoreboard of every player's
line and the match's kill feed. Both are public too under the leaderboards switch, at
`/s/<id>/matches`.

An org owner can **purge a server's stats** at the foot of its Settings tab: every recorded kill,
match and match row of the server is deleted, for good, after typing the server's name back.
Player sessions stay, since they are presence rather than stats. Careers and boards for the
server start again from the next match, and the match in progress is recorded from the purge on.
The purge is audited with the counts.

### Public pages

Two pages of a server can be opened to anyone with the address. An org owner **switches each on**
per server on the server's **Settings** tab, which shows the addresses to copy (the server's edit
dialog carries the same switches); nothing is public until then.
The site owner can **close** either page for a whole organisation from the org's page, next to
the server limit, which shuts every such page in it at once.

- **Live status** at `/s/<server id>`: map, mode, player count, join code and each team's players
  under its score with kills and deaths, refreshed every twenty seconds. A second switch under it
  adds the last twenty kills from the [kill feed](#kill-feed) (weapon, distance, names only).
- **Leaderboards and careers** at `/s/<server id>/leaderboard` and `/s/<server id>/players/<SteamID>`:
  the same board and career as the panel, over this server or the organisation's servers whose
  leaderboards are public too, less any [columns its owners left out](#seasons), with the player's
  kill-feed record (headshots, longest shot, weapons, most killed, nemeses). While this is on,
  names on the live page open the career.

Public pages never show pings, the build or the panel's own error text (an unreachable server
says only that it could not be reached), and read Steam personas from the cache only. The status
page shows in-game names alone. With leaderboards public, a player's SteamID is public too: it
is the address of their career, and the board, the live page's names and a career's most killed
and nemeses link by it; the board also shows the in-game cash. A public board goes twenty pages
deep (the top thousand); the panel's has no ceiling. A page that is off answers 404, so a closed page looks like no
page. An org owner can set the organisation's **Discord invite** link (discord.gg or
discord.com/invite), shown as a button on its public pages. Each page has a JSON twin under
`/api/public/servers/<id>`, rate limited per address and cacheable for a few seconds.

### Accounts and personal data

An account holds a username, display name, password hash if a password is set, the encrypted
authenticator secret and backup codes if the app is on, passkey public keys, the hash of a
recovery key, sessions (with the browser), the Discord id and avatar URL when Discord
is linked, and a SteamID64 when Steam is linked or the person enters one on the Account page (so
an organisation can hand them a reserved slot). Every sign-in and action is written to the audit
trail with the actor's name and browser. IP addresses are not kept: the panel reads a request's
address to throttle sign-ins and rate limit, in memory, and the login and sign-up lockouts store only a keyed
hash of it. No email address is ever asked for. Nothing else is collected, and nothing leaves
the panel.

Anyone can delete their own account from the **Account** page (right to erasure): password
accounts confirm with the password, the rest by typing their username after a recent sign-in.
Deletion removes the account, its credentials, passkeys, sessions, server roles and organisation
memberships at once. Audit entries the person caused stay for the record but lose their name and
browser, and entries that named them lose the username. The only owner of an organisation, or the only site owner, must
hand over first, so nothing is left without an owner. The site owner can delete anyone from the
Users tab of the Admin page under the same rules.

Analytics store the Steam id and in-game name of every player seen on a server, for a year (see
[Notes and limits](#notes-and-limits)). With `STEAM_API_KEY` set the panel also caches what the
Steam Web API says about each player it sees (persona, avatar, account creation date, ban
counts), and admins can leave notes and watchlist flags on players. If you host the panel for
other people, publish a privacy notice that says so, along with the audit retention you choose.

### Site owner controls

The **Admin** page (site owner only) has three tabs. **Overview** is the whole install at a
glance, refreshed every five seconds: players online, servers reachable, organisations and users,
kill feed and observation rates, the worker's tiers, queue and memory, the web process's request
and error figures, the database's size table by table, players seen today, this month and ever
(a tally cached for five minutes, with a Recount button), servers by game build, and whether the
[Prometheus endpoint](#metrics-prometheus) is on. **Users** manages every account and **Settings**
the runtime settings (cadences, delivery, retention). The old `/users` and `/settings` addresses
redirect to their tabs.

The Orgs page shows every organisation with its creator, member and server counts against its
limit, and status. From there (or from an org's own page) the site owner can raise or lower an
org's server limit and **suspend** it: members lose access to its servers, owners cannot add
servers or mint links, and invite links stop working, until it is restored. Deleting an org removes
its servers from the panel; the accounts stay. The org's page is also where the site owner can
**close** the [public pages](#public-pages) (status page, leaderboards and careers) for that
organisation; they are allowed for every organisation unless closed there.

### Bots and API keys

A Discord bot or a script talks to the same `/api` routes as the panel, with an organisation
**API key** instead of a session. An org owner mints one on the org page under **API keys**: a
label, the capabilities it carries (the same list roles use, see [Roles](#roles)), which servers it
may touch (or every server the org has, now and later), and an optional expiry. The token is shown
once; only its hash is stored. Everything a key changes is audited under `<label> (API key)`, and
so is every game action it is refused (game reads too, where `AUDIT_LOG_READS` is on). Revoking a
key on the org page ends it at once; a suspended organisation's keys stop working with it.

The rest of this section is the API as a key sees it. The example answers come from the built-in
demo server.

#### Calling the API

Send the token as a bearer to the address you open the panel at (its `ORIGIN`). A key needs no
cookie and no `X-Requested-With` header, and works on `/api` routes only; a page answers it with a
redirect to sign-in. Request bodies are JSON, sent with `Content-Type: application/json` (anything
else is a 415).

```sh
ORIGIN=https://panel.example.com
KEY=wck_…
# the servers the key covers: id, name, orgId, and the key's capabilities on each
curl -s "$ORIGIN/api/servers" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# a reserved slot on every server of the organisation
curl -s -X POST "$ORIGIN/api/orgs/$ORG_ID/lists/reserve/entries" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"steamId":"76561198000000000","reason":"donor"}'
```

Server and organisation ids come from `GET /api/servers` (`id`, `orgId`). `GET /api/orgs` lists
the organisations a person runs and is empty for a key, and a key without _View_ sees no servers,
so a key that carries only an org list takes its org id from the panel: the org page's address
ends in it (`/orgs/<id>`). Players are named by their SteamID64 (17 digits, as a string), and times
are ISO 8601 in UTC.

Every answer is JSON with `ok`. A refusal has an HTTP status to match and an `error`:

```json
{
	"ok": false,
	"error": {
		"message": "This needs 'Bans' on Demo One; your role 'API key' does not include it.",
		"code": "forbidden"
	}
}
```

Act on the status and `error.code`; the message is written for people and can change.

| Status | `error.code`                                            | When                                                                                                                                                |

#### What a key can do

On each server it covers a key holds its capabilities, and nothing more: it has no role in the
organisation. _View_ is the way in to a server; a key without it cannot see any. The organisation's
ban and reserved-slot lists are open to a key over every server that carries _Org ban list_ or _Org
reserved slots_; a key held to some servers cannot be given either. Whatever it carries, a key
manages nothing, and these answer it 403: the organisation's settings, members, roles, invite
links, webhooks and keys; adding, editing and deleting servers; the kill feed token; purging stats;
importing into the org lists; and every site owner route.

Answers name capabilities by id:

| `players.kill`         | Kill               |
| `players.move`         | Move               |

#### Reading a server

`GET /api/live` answers what the panel last saw on each server the key covers, or on those named in
`?ids=a,b` (ids the key cannot see are left out); `?org=<id>` narrows it to that organisation's,
for a list of servers too long for a URL, and `?slim=1` leaves out each server's `players`. It is
what the panel's own pages show and costs
the game server nothing. By default the panel reads the players every two seconds and the status
every five while people are on, and looks at an empty server every thirty seconds; `observedAt`
says when it last looked. Poll this rather than the game actions. `GET /api/servers/:id/summary`
answers the same for one server, with the key's capabilities there (its `ok` is the server's, as in
the live view).

```json

	"ok": true,

}
```

`ok` false means the last look did not reach the server, and `error` says why; `statusAt` and
`playersAt` say when the status and the players were last read. `gameServerId` is the join code.
Live builds report no `scoreCap` or `matchSeconds`, so those are null there. A player's `kills`,
`deaths` and `cash` are the in-game scoreboard's, which starts again every match.

`GET /api/live/events?ids=a,b` is the same as a stream of server-sent events: `live` (the object
above, at every look), `kills` (`{"type": "kills", "serverId": …, "kills": […]}`, as the kill
feed brings them) and `outbox` (what automation rules did, only on servers where the key holds
_Automation_), with a `: ping` comment every 15 seconds. The stream ends after five minutes;
connect again. While it is open its servers are looked at every second, as for a panel tab left
open, so hold it only while something needs updates that fast, or add `passive=1`: the servers
keep their usual cadence. It takes `org` and `slim` as above; `slim=1` sends `live` events only.

#### Game actions

Actions are the commands and reads that go straight to the game server:
`GET /api/servers/:id/rcon/:action` for reads, with any parameters in the query, and `POST` with the
parameters as a JSON body for anything that changes the game (a `GET` of one of those is a 405;
`POST` works for reads too). Each call goes to the game server there and then. `GET /api/actions`
lists every action with the capability it needs.

```sh
curl -s -X POST "$ORIGIN/api/servers/$SERVER_ID/rcon/broadcast" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message":"Restart in 5 minutes"}'
```

```json
{
	"ok": true,
	"action": "broadcast",
	"role": "API key",
	"result": { "message": "Announcement sent to 13 player(s)." },
	"durationMs": 1
}
```

`result` is the game server's answer. When the game refuses, `ok` is false, the status is the
game's (a 401 or a 5xx from it becomes a 502), and `error` carries the game's `code` and
`upstreamStatus`:

```json
{
	"ok": false,
	"action": "kick",
	"error": {
		"message": "Player not found: 76561198100009999",
		"code": "player_not_found",
		"upstreamStatus": 404
	}
}
```

`message` is cut at 256 characters, the most the game takes in a whisper or broadcast, and
`reason` at 200; rotation indexes count from 0. A SteamID goes as a string: as a JSON number it
loses its last digits, so it is refused.

`whisperMany` reads who is on and whispers each of them in turn, so a faction means whoever is on
it at that moment. It answers the SteamIDs in three lists: `sent`, `absent` (not on the server, or
gone before their turn) and `unsent`. A refusal from the game ends the run, as do ten seconds, and
`stopped` says which, with `retryAfterMs` when the game asked the panel to slow down. Each whisper
is sent once, so sending to `unsent` again reaches the rest. With no one to whisper it answers 404
`no_recipients`, and past 300 players a minute on one server 429 `rate_limited`.

The reads answer:

- `status`: the `status` object of the live view, read fresh; `players`: `{"players": […]}` as in
  the live view.
- `rotation`: `enabled`, `mode`, `nowIndex`, `nextIndex` and `entries`, each with `map`,
  `experiences`, `lighting`, `zoneAlternator`, `denied` and `status`.
- `bans`: `{"bans": [{"steamId", "bannedAtUtc", "bannedBy", "reason"}]}`; `reserved`:
  `{"reserved": [SteamIDs]}`.
- `maps`, `lightings` and `experiences`: `{"maps": [{"id", "display"}]}` and so on; `catalog` all
  three at once. The ids are what `changeMap` and `setWeather` take. `alternators`:
  `{"alternators": [{"tag", "display"}]}`, the tags `zoneAlternator` takes.
- `capabilities`: the routes the server's build serves, and `features`, which of the optional
  actions it has (`changeTeam`, `reservedSlots`, `rotationEdit`, `rotationSave`, `liveSettings`,
  `serverId`, `configDocument`).

Not every build of the game serves every action; one it lacks answers with the code `no_route`. On
a build without the reserved-slot routes, `reservedAdd` and `reservedRemove` edit the config
document instead, which the running server takes up at its next restart (the answer says so, with
`pendingRestart`). `POST /api/servers/:id/test` (_Config & settings_) is the panel's connection
test: it reaches the server and answers its `status`, `capabilities` and join code (`serverId`).

#### Bans and reserved slots

Ban and reserve through the panel's lists rather than the `ban` and `reservedAdd` actions:

| Route                                                                                                       | Needs                                                                                            |

| `PATCH` and `DELETE /api/orgs/:orgId/lists/:kind/entries/:steamId`                                          | the same                                                                                         |

| `GET /api/orgs/:orgId/lists`                                                                                | either list: the lists the key edits, their entry counts, the last sync on each server           |

| `POST /api/servers/:id/lists/ban/entries`, `PATCH` and `DELETE /api/servers/:id/lists/ban/entries/:steamId` | _Bans_ on that server: the server's own ban list                                                 |
| `POST /api/servers/:id/lists/reserve/entries`, `DELETE /api/servers/:id/lists/reserve/entries/:steamId`     | _Reserved slots_ on that server: the server's own slots                                          |
| `GET /api/servers/:id/lists/state`                                                                          | View: every ban and slot on the server by SteamID, which list it comes from, why and until when  |

An add takes `{"steamId": "…", "reason": "…", "expiresAt": "2026-10-01T00:00:00Z"}`. `reason`
(the note, on a reserved slot) is up to 200 characters; `expiresAt` is at least ten seconds and at most
ten years ahead, and left out for a permanent entry. A `PATCH` takes either or both, and
`"expiresAt": null` makes an entry permanent. A player already on the list is a 409 `duplicate`,
one who is not on it a 404. An add or a removal is applied at once, and its answer's `sync` says
how it went (`ok`, `added`, `removed`, `failed`, `error`): for the server's own list on that
server, for an org list once per server under `sync.servers`.

The panel enforces its bans itself: it removes a banned player from every server the list covers
the moment it sees them, with the organisation's ban message, whether or not they were on when the
ban was placed (see [Organisation ban and reserved lists](#organisation-ban-and-reserved-lists)).
The `ban` action writes to the game's own ban list instead, which the panel never lifts or expires
and shows as _local_, and the live game accepts it only for a player who is connected.
`reservedAdd` likewise puts a slot on the server outside the lists.

A rule's `config` is what the Automation tab's form saves for its kind, so the quickest way to a
valid one is to make the rule in the panel and read it back.

Other routes have no limit of their own. The live view changes at most every second, so polling it
faster than that gains nothing.

#### Without a key

A server whose public pages are on has JSON anyone can read, no key needed:
`GET /api/public/servers/:id` (the status page), and while its leaderboards are public
`.../leaderboard` (the leaderboard query above, twenty pages at most), `.../matches`,
`.../matches/:matchId` and `.../players/:steamId` (a career). Each answers 404 while its page is
off, and one address may make 120 of these requests a minute. See [Public pages](#public-pages).

#### Stability

This is the API the panel's own pages call, and it carries no version number: fields are added as
the panel grows, and a route can change between releases. Read the fields you use and ignore the
rest.

### Invite links

An org owner mints a link on the org page: it carries the org role joiners get (`member` or
`owner`), an optional default server role applied to every server the org has at that moment, an
optional expiry and an optional use limit. Opening `<ORIGIN>/join/<token>` shows the org name and a
**Continue with Discord** button; a Discord user without an account gets one (username derived from
their Discord handle), an existing user simply signs in, and either way they land back on the link
to confirm the join. People who already have a username can use that instead. Links can be revoked
at any time; whoever already joined keeps their access until an owner removes them.

### Reaching the game server

Warcon talks to the game's RCON listener over HTTP from its own process, so the panel can run
anywhere that can reach `Port` (default 7776) on each game host. Enable the listener in
`ServerSettings.ini` under `[/Script/WDRCON.WDRCONSettings]`, then connect however suits your setup:

- **Direct.** Set `BindAddress=0.0.0.0` (or the host's public address) and add the server in Warcon
  with scheme `http`. Restrict the port to Warcon's IP in whatever firewall the game host already
  has: the hosting provider's panel, `ufw`, a cloud security group. The RCON password is sent as a
  bearer token on every request, so the firewall is what keeps it private.
- **Private network.** Over WireGuard, Tailscale, or a provider LAN, bind the listener to the
  private address and use plain `http`.
- **TLS proxy on the game host.** Keep `BindAddress=127.0.0.1` and put Caddy (or nginx) in front of
  it; add the server with scheme `https` and port `443`. Caddy fetches a certificate for a public
  DNS name by itself.

      rcon.game1.example.com {
          reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:7776
      }

  For a self-signed certificate set `GAME_TLS_INSECURE=true`. This applies to every `https` server,
  not just the one that needs it.

- **Same host as the game server.** Keep `BindAddress=127.0.0.1`. From Compose, uncomment the
  `extra_hosts` line in `docker-compose.yml` and use host `host.docker.internal`, or run the
  container with `network_mode: host`.

Only the site owner can register a private target (loopback, `host.docker.internal`, RFC 1918,
a VPN address). Servers added by org owners must resolve to a public address, and every server is
re-checked before each request, so a hostname that later points somewhere internal is refused
rather than fetched. Link-local addresses (`169.254.0.0/16`, `fe80::/10`) are refused for everyone.
Refused targets are recorded on the audit page. The raw action is limited to `/v1/` paths on the
server's own port, and the connectivity test and raw action are rate limited per user.

The ini comments say a non-loopback `BindAddress` expects TLS and `PasswordHash=`; the official web
console connects over plain `http` regardless, and so can Warcon.

## Local development

Prerequisites: [Bun](https://bun.sh) 1.2+ and a Postgres (the TimescaleDB image is easiest).

```bash
bun install
docker run -d --name warcon-pg -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_USER=warcon -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=warcon \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=warcon timescale/timescaledb:2.30.0-pg18
cp .env.example .env      # set the two secrets, ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173, DATABASE_URL=postgres://warcon:warcon@127.0.0.1:5432/warcon
bun run dev               # http://localhost:5173 (single process: web + worker in-process)
bun run check             # svelte-check
bun run build && bun run start   # production build, http://localhost:3000 (set ORIGIN to match)
```

Before you push, run what CI runs: `scripts/ci.sh` goes through the same steps in the same order
(install, lint, check, the suites against a throwaway database, the production build and the smoke
test of that build; `--docker` adds the image build) with nothing from `.env`, since CI has none,
and stops at the first step CI would fail on. It needs the `warcon-pg-test` container the tests use
(`CI_DB` names another server) and port 5199 free. To have every push run it first:
`git config core.hooksPath .githooks`.

To run the split roles locally after `bun run build`: `bun run db:migrate`, then
`WARCON_ROLE=worker RELAY_SECRET=… bun run worker` in one terminal and
`WARCON_ROLE=web RELAY_SECRET=… RELAY_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7700 bun run start` in another.
`/api/health` on the web (and `/health` on the worker) answers a plain liveness check for anyone
(a monitor or the container healthcheck reads only `ok`); the worker's tiers, in-flight count,
"behind" and "stuck" figures and the delivery queue are added only for the site owner's own session
or a caller presenting `METRICS_TOKEN`, since they are fleet-wide. The Admin page's Overview tab
shows the same figures to the owner.

The schema is defined in [src/lib/server/db/schema.ts](src/lib/server/db/schema.ts). After changing
it, run `bun run db:generate` to write a new migration into `drizzle/`; the app applies pending
migrations at startup. Add a server with host `demo`, port `1`, password `demo` to use the mock game
server.

## Contributing

Issues, questions and pull requests are all welcome, and none of them needs to be polished. A
report that says "this looked wrong on my server" with a screenshot is useful.

**Contributing right now.** Warcon is early and moving fast: whole areas get rewritten in a week,
and features are pulled when they turn out to be the wrong idea. That makes it a good time to shape
it and a bad time to sit on a large branch. Feature ideas are wanted, and an issue that says what
you run and what you wish the panel did is as valuable as code. Bug reports, small fixes and tests
land quickly and survive rewrites. For anything bigger, open an issue first so it can be matched
against what is already in flight. What will not happen while this is true is a rewrite held back
to keep a pull request mergeable, so a change that lands before the code around it moves may be
reworked afterwards. That is not a judgement on the work.

What a change needs before it is merged:

- It works, and where the code is testable it has a test. Tests sit next to the code as
  `*.test.ts` and run with `bun test`.
- A new route, page load or game action has a line in the permission matrices under
  [src/test](src/test): they ask every route as every kind of person and key, and fail when one
  is missing. They need a Postgres to make a throwaway database on, named by
  `TEST_DATABASE_URL` (see `.env.example`); without it they are skipped locally, and CI runs them.
- CI passes: `bun run lint` (Prettier), `bun run check` (svelte-check), `bun test`,
  `bun run build` and the smoke test of the build, the steps [ci.yml](.github/workflows/ci.yml)
  runs; `scripts/ci.sh` runs them here first.
- The commit message says what behaviour changed, in plain words. Small whole commits are easier
  to review than one large one.
- It keeps data: analytics roll up rather than get pruned, and history stays.
- It considers per-server cost. A hosted install runs hundreds of servers on one worker, so a query
  per server per observation is hundreds of queries a second; servers a feature does not apply to
  should cost nothing.

Use whatever tools help you write it, including AI assistants; you do not need to declare which.
The change is what gets reviewed: does it work, is it tested, does the message say what it does.
You are the author of what you submit, so understand it and be ready to answer questions about it.
Warcon takes the same position the Linux kernel does, put plainly by Linus Torvalds in
[July 2026](https://lore.kernel.org/linux-media/CAHk-=wi4zC+Ze8e+p3tMv8TtG_80KzsZ1syL9anBtmEh5Z40vg@mail.gmail.com/):
AI is a tool like any other, contributions are judged on technical merit, and arguing against
other people using it is not a conversation this project will have.

The protocol notes in [docs/wardogs-api.md](docs/wardogs-api.md) describe what the game server
exposes; anything not in there is unknown to Warcon as well.

### API cheatsheet

All `/api` calls need either the session cookie (mutations then also need
`X-Requested-With: warcon`) or, on the routes a key may use, an organisation API key as
`Authorization: Bearer wck_…` ([Bots and API keys](#bots-and-api-keys) is the guide for bots).
Sign-in, setup, password change and session revocation are SvelteKit form actions on their pages,
which call Better Auth server-side behind the login lockout and the audit trail. Of Better Auth's
own `/api/auth/*` routes only the OAuth callback is reachable over HTTP; everything else answers 404.

## Notes and limits

- Analytics are derived from observation: player sessions are accurate to the cadence in force
  (a second or two on a busy server). A player missing from the list for under a minute is still
  in their session (the game reports nobody while a new map loads), and a leave is dated to the
  last time they were seen. Match boundaries are inferred from map changes, the
  faction scores falling back to zero and, on builds that send one, the match clock. Nothing is
  deleted: raw samples, their hourly rollups (behind the 30-day charts), sessions and matches are
  kept for good. On TimescaleDB, samples older than two weeks are compressed in place.
- On the Analytics charts per day, a player is new on the day their first session on that server
  began, as far back as the panel has watched it: in the first weeks after a server is added, its
  regulars count as new once each. A session counts on the day it ended, with its whole length, so
  one still running counts on none yet. Days are the viewer's own (the browser's time zone); over
  24 hours the charts go by the hour.
- Several `web` processes can share one database and one worker; the worker's lease makes exactly
  one process observe, and a second worker takes over within seconds if the first stops renewing.
  Run `WARCON_ROLE=all` as a single replica only: two `all` processes would each keep their own
  live view and lanes, and browsers on the one that does not hold the lease would see nothing live.
- Apart from the kill feed, the game has no push API. Freshness is the observation cadence, which the owner sets; the
  defaults (1 s players / 2 s status while watched, 2 s / 5 s while busy) are lighter on the game
  than the old per-browser polling was.
- Password hashing is Better Auth's default scrypt, which runs natively via `node:crypto` on Bun.
- Sessions are looked up in the database on every request (no cookie cache), so disabling a user
  or revoking a session takes effect immediately.
- Discord creates accounts only through an invite link, or anywhere it is offered when
  `ALLOW_ORG_SIGNUP` is on (`/sign-up` and the sign-in page); Better Auth's public sign-up and
  social sign-in endpoints are closed either way. Password accounts can link Discord from their
  Account page, and accounts created through Discord can set a password there to sign in by
  username as well.
- Upgrading an existing install: the migration creates one organisation named "Default" holding
  every server, with existing owners as its owners and everyone else as members. Rename it on the
  Orgs page.
- The demo server's state lives in process memory and resets on restart. Its players' SteamIDs are
  arbitrary, so with a Steam key some resolve to unrelated real accounts and others to "Not found".
- The risk score and the kick-on-connect trigger see only what this page describes. They cannot
  see aim, position, input or IP addresses; anything claiming to detect aimbots from the RCON API
  is guessing.
- Each player's totals per server (the all-time boards, career ranks, the placeholders' stats and
  the risk score's record of matches) and per server per UTC day (the 7, 30 and 90-day boards) are
  kept by triggers in the database, in the same transaction as whatever closes a session, ends a
  match or changes either afterwards, so a hand repair of a session, a match or a match row keeps
  them right by itself. Start such a repair with `SELECT player_totals_lock('<server id>');` and
  keep the default READ COMMITTED isolation (the triggers refuse any other). A closed session's
  `last_seen` must equal its `left_at` (the panel closes sessions so, and the ranged boards rely on
  it): the triggers refuse an edit that breaks that, so a repair that moves when a session ended
  sets both, and the migration that adds the day totals stops, before it locks anything, if a
  database already holds such a session: set one to the other first (for instance
  `UPDATE player_sessions SET last_seen = left_at WHERE left_at <> last_seen;`, which keeps the time
  the boards count playtime to) and deploy again. A bulk load (a backfill of history; a `TRUNCATE`
  of `player_sessions`, `matches` or `match_players`, which fires no trigger) runs in one
  transaction that disables the `player_totals_*` triggers on those tables, loads, runs
  `SELECT player_totals_rebuild();` (both kinds of totals; it refuses to run over a closed session
  that breaks the rule) and enables them again: writers wait for it, readers do not.
- Audit rows are never deleted by the panel. Prune them with SQL if you need to. Deleting an
  account pseudonymises its rows rather than removing them (see
  [Accounts and personal data](#accounts-and-personal-data)).
