// One observation of one game server, and the worker's memory of every server it watches.
//
// An observation reads status and/or the player list (whichever is due), diffs the players
// against the open sessions, evaluates the server's triggers, and commits all of it in a single
// fenced transaction: session rows, trigger intents (the outbox), the live snapshot and, when
// something changed or the heartbeat is due, an analytics sample. Nothing is sent to the game
// from here; outbox.ts does that afterwards. Then the slower housekeeping runs, each part on its
// own: match bookkeeping, ban-list snapshot, org-list sync, Steam warm-up.
