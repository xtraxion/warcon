// The Team balance rule's pure part (kind `two_teams`, first built as Two-team mode). Two jobs, either
// or both: a closed faction, whose players are moved to the smaller of the others, so a
// three-faction server plays as two big teams; and balancing, which keeps the open sides within a
// few players of each other without taking anyone out of a fight. A player who is playing is never
// moved mid-match: balancing places a player when they arrive, puts back a player who switches
// onto the bigger side themselves, and evens everyone up when a new match starts. The game has no
// two-team setting of its own; its overpopulation lock sends joiners to the closed, empty faction,
// and this rule places them from there. No database, no game server: triggers.ts runs the step on
// each fresh player list, keeps its state in the worker's memory and writes the moves to the
// outbox.
