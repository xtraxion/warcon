// A server's stats purge: what the game recorded about play on it (its kills, matches and match
// rows) deleted for good by an org owner, audited with the counts. Sessions stay: they are
// presence (who was on, playtime, seed time, first visits), not stats. The worker needs no nudge:
// it re-reads the open match row on every status look and opens a new one when none is, so a
// match in progress is recorded from the purge onward as a fresh row, and the feed's next batch
// carries that row too.
