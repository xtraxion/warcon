// kills, suicides, vehicle kills and streaks, time on and the side played) joined to its match
// for the result, and the sessions for playtime, seed time, the last name and cash. All time is
// read from each player's settled totals per server (player_totals, kept by the database as
// sessions close and matches end, migration 0038) plus the open sessions; a range (7, 30, 90
// days) or a season still running from the same totals per UTC day (player_days, migration 0039)
// plus its partial first day and the open sessions; a finished season from the day rows too, cut
// at its end. A page of a board is kept for a minute (loadBoard). Only matches that have ended
// count, and a match is in a range or a season by when it ended; the match in progress is on the
// live page. The result of a match for a player (win, loss, draw, none) is the rule in
// $lib/leaderboard, written out again in SQL below for the aggregates (and once more, as
