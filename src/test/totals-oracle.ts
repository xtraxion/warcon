// The all-time and ranged reads as they were before player_totals and player_days (main at
// edf2aab), word for word, for the exactness tests to hold the totals against: each sums every
// session and every line of an ended match on the servers asked about, since `from` (the epoch for
// all time). A finished season's read is the same sums cut at its end (seasonSums). The time
// behind the cash (cash_minutes) is each counted session's whole length, from its join; the rows
// below compare its value, not its scale (parts that cancel sum to 0.000000 where this reads 0).
// Frozen on purpose: if the reads' meaning changes, this file changes with it in the same commit,
// deliberately. totalsRows, rangeRows and seasonRows, at the end, are the other side.
